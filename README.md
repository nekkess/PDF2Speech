# PDF2Speech
This is a custom project made to convert PDF to speech, basically creating free audiobooks.
Voice RSS API was used to read the text.

If you'd like to test out the project you can create a free account at Voice RSS, get your own API key and use the code!
Unfortunately, due to the constrictions of the free API plan the audio length is limited and the voice does sound pretty unnatural.
